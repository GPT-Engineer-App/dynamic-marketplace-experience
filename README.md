# dynamic-marketplace-experience

Create a dynamic multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace inspired by drakerelated.com, supporting a variety of local businesses including clothing, fragrances, and furniture stores. Each business should be able to customize their storefront with different templates to reflect their physical storeâ€™s aesthetic. Include features for product uploads, AI-assisted photo and description optimization, payment tracking, and shipping assistance. The interface should offer a virtual, interactive shopping experience, making users feel as if theyâ€™re navigating through a real store.
